# multi-ems

"multi-channel EMS" with Processing and Arduino.  
Simultaneous output of maximum of 20 channels are available.  
The board is designed for "Human Augmentation Summer School 2017."  
Permissions are required for any other personal usage.


## Description

The Processing sends serials to a master Arduino.


- ems_digital:  
  The master Arduino communicates with the slave Arduino via I2C.
  Control voltage by digital output.

- ems_analog:  
  Control voltage by analog output.

## Installation

- Put this repo in your Arduino or Wiring "libraries" folder. 

## Dependencies

- [StandardCplusplus](https://github.com/maniacbug/StandardCplusplus)

## Read Before Use

- Use only under confident understandings of EMS. 
  - You can see details from other great projects. https://github.com/PedroLopes/openEMSstim
- The board and softwares are NOT medically approved. Always use the device following author's instruction.
- Do NOT leave the power on when it is not in use.
- Do NOT place electrodes to dangerous parts of the body. E.g., around the chest/heart.
- Take care of the output voltage. While manipulating the output by the analog version, the volume may rotate in unintended conditions.
- See LICENCE.
- Follow the Liabilirt Waiver before usage.
