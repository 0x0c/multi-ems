# multi-ems

"multi-channel EMS" with Processing and Arduino.  
Simultaneous output of maximum of 20 channels are available.  
  
**This version is under development.**  
This version has several significant improvements from the prior version.  
  
  
## Description

The Processing sends serials to a master Arduino.  
The master Arduino communicates with the slave Arduino via I2C.
  
One board has 4 output channels.  
However, the channels can be increased by using multiple boards.  
In this case, minor revision is required for the source codes.

- multiEMSSlave: The slave Arduino for voltage adjusting pulse generation (500 Hz max)
  


## Board Detail




## Read Before Use

- Use only under confident understandings of EMS. 
  - You can see details from other great projects [here.](https://github.com/PedroLopes/openEMSstim)  
  - You can see an overview of related work in my [article.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3184743)  
- The board and softwares are NOT medically approved. Always use the device following author's instruction.
- Do NOT leave the power on when it is not in use.  
- Do NOT place electrodes to dangerous parts of the body. E.g., around the chest/heart.
- Take care of the output voltage. 
- See LICENSE.
- Follow the Liability Waiver before usage.  
- It is important to use an individual power source for the 3V input (noted as Battery in the figure) due to safety reasons. I.e., do not use the Arduino 3.3V output.   
- The voltage changes exponentially.  
- Do not use the audio jack and the socket outputs simultaneously (however, it is possible to do so, but you must understand the theory of the circuit to do so).  



## Developing your own Board

Follow the partslist.txt.  
- There are optional parts for implementation, where you can adjust some parameters by yourself.  
- You can adjust the current limitation, as well as LPF/HPF, or otherwise you can just leave them unused by inserting jumpers.  
- Audio jacks are optional, which you can simply use the other sockets for electrode connection.  
- The audio jacks are compatible with [Omrons cables](https://store.healthcare.omron.co.jp/item/HV_CODE_K.html) and [electrodes](https://store.healthcare.omron.co.jp/item/HV_LLPAD_3P.html).  
- T5,T8,T10,T12can be used for current limitation. Insert them in with a 6--12Î© resistor (R37,R40,R43,R47). Otherwise insert jumper wires between C-E of the transistor.  
- Use the Arduino bootloader and duplicate the Arduino with ATmega328P (or buy one from [stores](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/663/)). Then write the 'multiEMSSlave.ino' to the microcomputer.  
- There are issues in the current board. C1,C2,C7,C9 should be **1uF**, not 10uF. C3,C23,C25,C26 can overlap with the audio jacks.  
  

## Electrodes
