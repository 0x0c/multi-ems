# multi-ems

multi-channel EMS with Processing and Arduino.


## Description

The Processing sends serials to a master Arduino.


- ems_digital:  
  The master Arduino communicates with the slave Arduino via I2C.
  Control voltage by digital output.

- ems_analog:  
  Control voltage by analog output.

  - emsFaceArd_2: The master Arduino for EMS pulse generation
  - wire_ems: The slave Arduino for voltage adjusting pulse generation (500 Hz max)
  - wire_ems_time (recommended): The slave Arduino for voltage adjusting pulse generation (500 Hz max), gradually increase the output voltage

## Read Before Use

- Use only under confident understandings of EMS. 
  - You can see details from Pedro Lopes's work. https://github.com/PedroLopes/openEMSstim
- The board and softwares are NOT medically approved. Always use the device following author's instruction.
- Do NOT leave the power on when it is not in use.
- Do NOT place electrodes to dangerous parts of the body. E.g., around the chest/heart.
- Take care of the output voltage. While manipulating the output by the analog version, the volume may rotate in unintended conditions.
- See LICENCE.
- Follow the Liabilirt Waiver before usage.
